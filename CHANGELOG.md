# Changelog

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **AAC/M4A output format** — 128 kbps AAC in M4A container for Apple device compatibility
- **Configurable MP3 bitrate** — choose 128, 192, 256, or 320 kbps from the format selector
- **.dcr format detection** — Liberty Court Recorder files are identified with guidance to export via Liberty software
- **Dynamic channel count** — auto-detects 4–16 channel recordings and resizes the UI accordingly
- **Retry button** — failed conversions show a retry action instead of requiring re-import
- **Extended channel palette** — 16 distinct colors for multi-channel recordings (up from 4)

### Changed
- Drop zone moved above configuration panels for a more natural top-down workflow
- Progress bar now shows real percentage derived from FFmpeg duration probe
- Stereo mix uses actual detected channel count instead of hardcoded 4

### Fixed
- Vite 8 build — switched minifier from deprecated esbuild to oxc

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Track preview** — audition individual channels before conversion for quick identification (Reporter, Witness, Attorney 1 & 2)
- **Mix audition** — preview the final stereo mix with per-channel volume and processing applied
- **Processing preview** — hear the effect of high-pass filter, normalization, and silence trimming before committing
- **Cancel conversion** — stop an in-progress conversion at any time; partially written files are cleaned up automatically
- **Atomic file writes** — output files are written to a temporary path first, then moved into place, preventing corrupted files on crash or cancel
- **Global audio player** — persistent playback bar with queue support across Convert and Library views
- **React error boundary** — catches unhandled UI crashes and offers a recovery button instead of a blank screen
- Dependabot configuration for automated dependency updates
- MIT LICENSE file and CODEOWNERS

### Changed
- Upgraded React 18 → 19 and react-dom to 19.2.4
- Upgraded Vite 7 → 8 (Rolldown-based bundler)
- Upgraded @vitejs/plugin-react 4 → 6 (Babel removed, Oxc-based transforms)
- Updated Cargo dependencies including tauri-plugin-updater to 2.10.0
- Updated CI actions (actions/checkout v6, actions/setup-node v6)
- Improved conversion progress UI with smoother status updates

### Security
- Bumped `tar` crate 0.4.44 → 0.4.45 (fixes symlink-directory collision chmod attack)
- Bumped `rustls-webpki` 0.103.9 → 0.103.10

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- In-app auto-updater powered by GitHub Releases — update notifications with change notes and skip option
- Shared audio player hook (`useAudioPlayer`) reducing code duplication
- ARIA labels and semantic roles throughout the UI for accessibility
- Update banner component with download progress and release notes viewer

### Fixed
- **Critical:** `ConvertJob` serde deserialization — added `camelCase` rename so frontend `srcPath`/`outDir`/`chanVols`/`fadeDur` fields map correctly to Rust struct
- macOS Intel CI builds — replaced deprecated `macos-13` runner with cross-compilation on `macos-latest`
- Toggle component accessibility — changed from `<div>` to `<button role="switch">` with keyboard support

### Changed
- ConvertTab now accepts grouped prop objects (`prefs`, `fileDrop`, `conversion`) instead of 30+ individual props
- Consolidated duplicate `.proc-chain` CSS definitions
- Updated README with full feature docs, architecture overview, and format support table
- Replaced placeholder SECURITY.md with actual project information

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-11

### Changed
- Refactored Rust backend from single 806-line `lib.rs` into 7 focused modules:
  - `types.rs` — all struct/enum definitions
  - `helpers.rs` — format registry, path helpers, SGMCA stripping
  - `ffmpeg.rs` — FFmpeg probe, filter chain, sidecar runner
  - `conversion.rs` — core conversion logic (stereo/keep/split)
  - `persistence.rs` — library and preferences storage
  - `commands.rs` — Tauri command handlers
  - `lib.rs` — module declarations and app builder
- Added `protocol-asset` feature to Tauri dependency
- Skipped macOS code signing for unsigned builds
